# Java-Practice

During my free time, I enjoy practising on my Java, JavaScript and HTML. I have created these applications during summer to preprare myself for the second year of studies.

Please note that most of the code was written couple of months back, therefore the code quality might not be up to the highest standards, if I would be writing those applications and games again, they would take definetely less time and would be definetely written better.
